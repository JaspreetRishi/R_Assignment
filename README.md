#R Assignment
Carter Newton

##General Orginization

- I have included .RData files in accordance to what Part they were used for
- I'm hoping by providing those that you can knit my RMarkdown file and everything should generate as long as the working directory is set in the file that views both folders called "Part1" and "Part2" 

- I got stuck on the last graph and truly don't know how to make it
- If you have any advice I would greatly appreciate it!
- If not I do plan on continuing to work on it this weekend and hopefully I can get it figured out soon!
